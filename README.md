TF-IDF Based Text Recommender Model
This repository contains a machine learning model that uses TF-IDF to recommend relevant text documents to users based on their input queries.

The model is built using Python and the following libraries:

Pandas
Scikit-learn
NLTK
Getting Started
To use the model, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine
Install the required libraries (Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK)
Run the script train.py to train the model on your dataset
Once the model is trained, you can use the predict.py script to generate recommendations based on user queries.
Model Details
The TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) model is a popular information retrieval technique that assigns a numerical value to each word in a document, based on its frequency in the document and its rarity in the entire corpus of documents.

The TF-IDF values for each word in the document are then used to calculate a similarity score between the query and each document in the corpus. The documents with the highest similarity scores are then recommended to the user.

Dataset
The model requires a dataset of text documents to be trained on. The dataset should be in CSV format, with each row representing a single document and containing the following columns:

id - a unique identifier for the document
title - the title of the document
text - the content of the document
Performance
The performance of the model can be evaluated using standard metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
